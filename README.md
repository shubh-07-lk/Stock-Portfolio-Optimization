# Stock Portfolio Optimization

Welcome to the **Stock Portfolio Optimization** project!

This repository contains an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based model to predict stock market behavior and a sentiment analysis script to further enhance the model's predictive capability.

---

## üîç Project Overview

- **LSTM Model**: A deep learning model using historical stock price data to predict future trends.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: A Python script to analyze market sentiment from news or other textual data, providing an additional signal for prediction.

---

## üìä Files in this Repository

- `LSTM model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the LSTM model development.
- `keras_model.h5`: Saved trained LSTM model.
- `senti.py`: Python script for sentiment analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of all required Python libraries (will be included).

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
https://github.com/shubh-07-lk/stock-portfolio-optimization.git
cd stock-portfolio-optimization
```

### 2. Install the Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the LSTM Model
- Open the `LSTM model.ipynb` notebook.
- Train or evaluate the model using historical stock data.

### 4. Run Sentiment Analysis
```bash
python senti.py
```

## üí° Technologies Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy / Pandas / Matplotlib
- NLTK / TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
